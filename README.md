# DataStructuresAndAlgorithmsInPython
<p> This branch will contains implementation of most common data structures in Python along with the Excercise solutions of the book Data Structures And Algorithms In Python</p>
<p> The main data structures covered will be as following</p>

Data Structures | Description 
----------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arrays          | Most Common Data Structure in Computer Science for storing items in contiguous memory locations but have a fixed size
Dynamic Arrays  | Mostly commonly known As Lists in C#, ArrayList In Java, They can resize dynamically but are built on arrays internally
LinkedLists     | These are based on A Node class mostly which contains links to next and previous nodes. The items can be found by Traversing these links in the nodes
Stacks          | They follow Last In First Out Principle and can be built on top of arrays, lists or even linked Lists
Queues          | They follow FIFO principle and can be built on top of data structures such as Arrays, Lists or even circular arrays or linked Lists
Priority Queues | They are basically queues but every item in the queue has some sort of priority 
Heaps           | These are based on trees. Complete Implementation will be posted on the branch with runtime analysis for different functions
Trees           | These can be based on arrays etc and complete implementation will be posted on the branch
Tries           | **Built on top of trees
Graph Algorithms| Path Finding Algorithms, Digikstra, BreadthFirst Search, Depth First Search etc
